# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For any security issues or vulnerabilities, please use one of the following methods:

- **GitHub Private Reporting**: [Create a new Security Advisory](https://github.com/envygeeks/envygeeks.io/security/advisories)

Since this is a personal site, I do not have a fixed timeline for security updates, but I will address any reported issues as soon as possible. _**I do not update users about individual issues, but I will fix them when discovered.**_

## Policy

This is my personal website. I prioritize fixing any reported issues but do not guarantee updates on a specific schedule.
